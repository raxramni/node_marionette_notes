# Boilerplate npm Webpack Backbone and Express

## Install

1. ```npm install```
2. ```npm start```
3. ```http://localhost:3000```






Couldn't do tests for right now and the backend is very basic (db interactions in sync and without validations) 
Schedule's been crazy hectic to devote more time to it at the moment.
